This is the top level Readme. 

For convenience we offer a bash script to simplify using our system. 

## Run the system
1. download the corpus files and place them in the src directory
2. make script executable: `chmod +x run.sh`
3. Execute `./run.sh --help`. This will help you set up the environment and train or evaluate models.
