# Clausal Coordinate Ellipsis
This is the top level Readme. 
For more information have a look at src/README.md

For convenience we offer a bash script to simplify using our system. 

*NOTE:* this system requires CUDA, but it should be possible to deactivate this dependency, which will result in much longer runtimes. 

## Run the system
1. download the corpus files and place them in the src directory
2. make script executable: `chmod +x run.sh`
3. Execute `./run.sh --help`. This will help you set up the environment and train or evaluate models.
